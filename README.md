# Simple-CPU
Here is a simple CPU en VHDL which support part of RISC instructions which is just for the study of architecture of processor. It can finish some simple jobs by 
executing the binary code stored in ROM, you can change it by modifying the code in module ROM of project VHDL. Il has been tested not only in Modelsim but also on board FPGA Altera.

It don't support pipeline and virtual address.
